# Language-Translator
This is a dynamic language translator developed using Flask, HTML-CSS, Bootstrap, Python, JS, Flask and some API's

Limitations of This Translator:
1)Text: Though it works for most of the languages dynamically it cannot perform Chinese translation having Chinese as destination language to translate it into Chinese we have to enter the destination language as Chinese (Simplified) or Chinese (Traditional)
2)Voice: This is just a one-way translator it converts English audio to Hindi Text and Audio. The working of this translator has been demonstrated by us in the following video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUZ3vOpTqcU) Making This Voice Translator Dynamic is the future scope of this project
